When is better to use POST vs GET request?

Generally, POST should be used for sending data to server, GET for receiving data from server. 
GET request should not be used for transferring sensitive data, such as login/password. Because parameters in GET request are passed via URL. 
Also, GET request should not be used when we need send long string to server. GET requests have length restrictions.
